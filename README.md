# Result-a-day-using-switch-
In this program, the user is prompted to enter the number of the day of the week, and the switch statement maps that number to the corresponding day of the week. If the user enters an invalid number (i.e. one that is not between 1 and 7), an error message is displayed. The break statements are used to exit each case once the output has been printed, to prevent any fall-through behavior.
